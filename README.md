### Hi there 👋

I'm Omar Zaffar! I'm Machine Learning Engineer, amatuer endurance racer and a pro home cook. I want to build data models that will make impacts to people's lives, whether if that's with autonomous driving to systems that will accuratlly predict when the driver needs to stop and rest based on their driving patterns over time to intelligent voice assistants that wil learn each individuals accents. 

🏁 My hobbies include: 
* Building and racing cars
* Cooking
* Motorcycles
* Gaming and streaming
* Filming and Video Editing
